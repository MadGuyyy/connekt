Communications Platform

Connekt is a multi-tenant platform for engagement via. push notification & pull messages, which aims towards evolving into a multi-channel communications platform.

#### Motivation behind Connekt

Following drawbacks were found in existing in-house last-mile engagement platforms:

- they are built with contrastingly different tech-stacks
- no common contract for understanding deliverability / failures
- each platform suffered from throughput limitation
- building a reliable ETL pipe is not feasible for any of the platform (or) comes with additional maintenance overhead
- none of the platforms ensure clientsâ€™ individual sla are insulated from each other
- none of the platforms have clean authentication, authorization control over api
